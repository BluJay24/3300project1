# CS3300_Project 1

First project for CS/INFO 3300, a course on Data Driven Web Applications at Cornell University. 

The goal of this project is to create a static and meaningful data representation using SVG, JavaScript, and the D3 library. 

Our project focuses on the web's influence and impact around the world, and how web applications have altered different country's progress. 

Additionally, we have taken our data and compared it to the education level and committment of individual countries to note geographical/political similarities as well as outliers in those cases.
